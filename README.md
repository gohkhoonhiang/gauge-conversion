README

There are two versions of this code, the neatly separated html/css/js and the all-in-one html/css/js.

The reason I have the index-min.html is because I wanted to host the file on Google Drive and it's easier to do with a single file.

I will keep the neatly separated html/css/js for best practice purpose. May host it in future if I get my own server.
